# Introduction to the Model Asset eXchange on IBM Developer

The [Model Asset eXchange](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/) (MAX) on IBM Developer is a place where you can find and use free open source deep learning models for text, image, audio, and video processing and much more. The curated list includes _deployable_ models, which you can run as a microservice locally or in the cloud on Docker or Kubernetes, and _trainable_ models.

 - [**Module 1: Run a deep learning microservice on Docker**](modules/module1) (Estimated time: 30 minutes) 
   - Run a microservice using a pre-built Docker image
   - Run a microservice using a custom-built Docker image
 - [**Module 2: Consume a deep learning microservice**](modules/module2/) (Estimated time: 20 minutes) 
   - Customize a sample Node.js or Python web app to consume a microservice
